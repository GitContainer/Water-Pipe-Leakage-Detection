# Water-Pipe-Leakage-Detection
An IoT project which helps in determining the amount of water lost due to a leakage and the location of that leakage in a pipe using ESP8266 module and water flow sensors.
There are times when a pipe breaks and lakhs of litres are wasted then and there. 
It becomes difficult to detect leakages beforehand and try to take a proper action accordingly. 
Even in homes, the leakage occurs at one point in the water system, but the actual issue is because of another point in the system.  
There definitely exist a sense of realisation to save and preserve pure and potable water for future use.  
If such leakages go undetected and predominant then the above is not possible
